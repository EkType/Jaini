    Jainī is a Devanāgarī typeface based on the calligraphic style of the Jain Kalpasūtra manuscripts. The design of
    this font is based on the 1503 Kalpasūtra manuscript. Jainī has several unique features not seen in Bāḻabodha, these
    include disconnected śirōrēkhā with triangular wedges, short upper mātrās, squarish letters with large kānā-height,
    heavy knots, and lower matrās integrated within the kānā height. Since the original manuscript uses letter-shapes
    which are not familiar to contemporary readers, these have been redesigned along with Latin numbers and
    punctuations.

    Two separate fonts offering two different conjunct styles are available:
    Jaini (horizontal conjuncts) and Jaini Purva (vertical conjuncts).
